 ## UX

### Project Goals 
The website will be called my tax free shopping. It promotes tax free shopping (TFS) to all non-EU tourists. Any tourist traveller visiting Ireland is entitled to claim their vat back. Currently there are three main operators in the market, Planet, Horizon and Innova. All of the current providers operate on a B2B model; they work directly with retailers to issue TFS sales to tourists. They work off a commission share model refund agent/retailer/tourist. My tax free shopping is giving the tourist choice to work with an agent that is only working for them to ensure they get a maximum refund cutting out large fees from retailers and agents. 
The solution will eliminate the need for long forms and long queues at the airport. The tourist/traveller will use the snap and send all receipts to my tax free shopping who will then process the claim with customs and revenue.
The main aim of the business is to remove the need for tourist/travellers to use multiple providers and also to get a higher tax refund. 
This website is for all potential customers who are non-EU tourists/travelers.

 ### Design Choices
 #### Typography
- I used Monterrat for my fonts from Google fonts as i felt it was clear, relaxed and read very well. 
- I also used san-serif as a fall back in the event of font not supported. 
- I used all lowercase from a design perspective as it gave a much more relaxed view to a customer. Most of the corporate websites that work for the retailer instead of the customer have corporate websites. I wanted my tax free shopping to be simple, easy and customer focused. 
 #### Colors
- The main color throughout the website is a purple #5E17EB. I used the color picker from the logo i created to find the #5E17EB. I used css gradient to create some nice circle gradient.
 #### Images
- I created mytaxfreeshopping logo from Canva. 
- All of the images used were from pixels and i they are mostly airport setting images to keep with the theme of travel. 
- Any icons i used were taken from fontawesome.
