 <p>Visitors to Ireland from outside the European Union (EU) can buy goods in Ireland to take home with them and benefit from tax relief. This is called the Retail Export Scheme. It includes visitors from Great Britain, but does not include people resident in Northern Ireland.
    Tax relief is not allowed on services, for example, hotel accommodation, meals or car hire. The visitor must provide proof that they are a visitor from outside the EU when making each purchase. The proof includes evidence of the place of residence, inbound and outbound flight dates and a signed declaration.</p>
<h2>in order to qualify for a refund: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>you must be a resident outside of the EU</li>
    <li>the goods must have a total export value of more the â‚¬75 including tax</li>
    <li>the goods must be exported out of the EU within 3 months from the end of the month in which they were bought</li>
    <li>you must supply documentary proof that the goods have been exported</li>
    
</ul>
