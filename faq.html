           <p>Dublin Airport is an international airport serving Dublin, Ireland. It is operated by DAA (formerly Dublin Airport Authority).[5] The airport is located 7 km (4.3 mi) north[2] of Dublin, in Collinstown, and 3 km (1.9 mi) south of the town of Swords.

            In 2019, 32.9 million passengers passed through the airport, making it the airport's busiest year on record.[6] It is the 12th busiest airport in Europe, and is by far the busiest of Ireland's airports by total passenger traffic; it also has the greatest traffic levels on the island of Ireland, followed by Belfast International Airport.
            
            The airport has an extensive short and medium haul network, served by an array of carriers, as well as a significant long-haul network focused on North America and the Middle East. It serves as the headquarters of Ireland's flag carrier – Aer Lingus, Europe's largest low-cost carrier – Ryanair, and ASL Airlines Ireland, together with another two airlines, CityJet and Norwegian Air International.[7]
            
            United States border preclearance services are available at the airport for U.S.-bound passengers. Shannon Airport is the only other airport in Europe to offer this facility.</p>

           <p>Shannon Airport is an international airport located in County Clare in the Republic of Ireland. It is adjacent to the Shannon Estuary and lies halfway between Ennis and Limerick. The airport is the third busiest airport in the Republic of Ireland, and the fifth busiest on the island. In 2018, Shannon Airport handled 1,864,762 passengers, a 6.5% annual increase.[citation needed]

            The airport has a history of pioneering in global aviation with the first transatlantic proving flight in 1945, the world's first duty-free airport opening in 1947 and Europe's first United States border preclearance facility opening in 1986. It was a busy refuelling stop for many international carriers in the 1960s, making it a gateway between Europe and the Americas.[6] At 3,199 metres (10,495 ft), Shannon has the longest runway in Ireland (which allowed it to be a designated alternative landing site for the Space Shuttle).[7]</p></div>

           <p>Cork Airport is the second-largest of the three principal international airports in the Republic of Ireland, after Dublin and ahead of Shannon. It is located 6.5 km (4.0 mi)[1] south of Cork city centre in an area known as Farmers Cross.[5] In 2018, Cork Airport handled 2,392,821,[6] growing by 8.3% to 2,585,466 passengers as of 2019 and representing a fourth consecutive year of growth. Aviation was severely impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic in 2020 and passenger numbers at Cork Airport fell to 530,000, a decline of 80%.[7] Cork is the state's second-busiest airport in terms of passenger numbers, after Dublin, and third busiest on the island of Ireland, after Dublin and Belfast International.</p></div>
