 ## UX

### Project Goals 
The website will be called my tax free shopping. It promotes tax free shopping (TFS) to all non-EU tourists. Any tourist traveler visiting Ireland is entitled to claim their vat back. Currently, there are three main operators in the market, Planet, Horizon, and Innova. All of the current providers operate on a B2B model; they work directly with retailers to issue TFS sales to tourists. They work off a commission share model refund agent/retailer/tourist. My tax free shopping is giving the tourist choice to work with an agent that is only working for them to ensure they get a maximum refund cutting out large fees from retailers and agents. 
The solution will eliminate the need for long forms and long queues at the airport. The tourist/traveler will use the snap and send all receipts to my tax free shopping who will then process the claim with customs and revenue.
The main aim of the business is to remove the need for tourist/travelers to use multiple providers and also to get a higher tax refund. 
This website is for all potential customers who are non-EU tourists/travelers. 

### User Stories 
#### Site User
- As a user of this site, I want to know how tax free shopping works so I can get a refund.
- As a user of this site, I want to know how much money I will get back as this will help me decide how much I will spend. 
- As a user of this site, I want to know how much the processing fee is so I know what company to use and I get the best value.
- As a user of this site, I want to be able to contact my tax free shopping if I want to follow up on my refund or to ask a question. 
- As a user of this site, I want to be able to use this website fully from my mobile/tablet while at the airport. 
- As a user of this site, I want to find out the address of this company easily without having to fill out a contact us form. 
- As a user of this site, I want links to social media so I can check for any issues with past customers or ask any questions. 
#### Site Owner
- As a site owner, I want the customer journey to be as seamless as possible. 
- As a site owner, I want to make sure the user finds the website and they find it informative and understand the process. 
- As a site owner, I want to generate refunds for the customer.
- As a site owner, I want to highlight that there is no need to work with any other refund agent. 
 

 ### Design Choices
 #### Typography
- I used Montserrat for my fonts from Google fonts as i felt it was clear, relaxed, and read very well. 
- I also used san-serif as a fallback in the event of the font not being supported. 
- I used all lowercase from a design perspective as it gave a much more relaxed view to a customer. Most of the corporate websites that work for the retailer instead of the customer have corporate websites. I wanted my tax free shopping to be simple, easy, and customer-focused. 
- I used a link height of 2 to make it easy to read.

 #### Colors
- The main color throughout the website is purple #5E17EB. I used the color picker from the logo I created to find the #5E17EB. I used CSS gradient to create some nice radial gradients.

 #### Images
- I created mytaxfreeshopping logo from Canva. 
- All of the images used were from pixels and they are mostly airport setting images to keep with the theme of travel. 
- Any icons I used were taken from fontawesome. 
- List of images:
1. **Hero image** - used on the homepage. Image of a large shopping center showing people in all the different areas. The image is clean and crisp. It has light colors so I could use a dark text with it for good contrast. 
2. **About image** - used on the about page. Image of a guy in an airport. The majority of what the user needs to do is in the airport so a lot of my images come from there. The image shows the man from a distance by the windows on his phone. We want our customers like this in a calm area of the airport to complete their claim from their phone. 
3. **How it works** includes a picture of a lady smiling holding a ballon. My Tax Free shopping wants all their customers to be smiling and feeling good. There were also icons taken from fontawesome in this section.  
4. **FAQ image** - two airplanes in the sky. Good use of color from the sky that blends well against the purple. 
5. **Contact image** - The cliffs of Moher image is used a lot in marketing and advertising and the majority of tourists visiting Ireland would visit here so they would have some recognition. 


#### Wireframes 
The wireframes were designed using Figma. My wireframes can be found here:
